  AI skills\, supercharge productivity and make you the go-to person for AI
  in the workplace. \nFor Businesses\nThe first step in building your inter
 nal AI capability is to demystify AI and understand what it can and can't 
 do without the tech industry hype. Starting from this solid Foundation we 
 can support building out your AI capability with our Skills and Advanced c
 ourses for your team.\nWhat's in the workshop?\nOur half-day Foundations w
 orkshop will equip you with:\nAI Theory (That Won't Put You to Sleep): Und
 erstand how AI ticks under the hood without needing a math PhD.\nExtractin
 g real business value: AI is an endless goldmine of value\, learn how to '
 mine' it safely.\nRisks and challenges: Learn about what is meant when we 
 say AI "hallucinates"\, the bias risks and how they can be managed.\nThe n
 ew frontier: AI has upended the status quo to the extent everything will n
 eed to be revalauated\, learn to seperate the low-hanging fruit from the A
 I slop (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html).\nEa
 ch course is also paired with access to a 3 month subscription to Practica
 l:AI User Group portal:\nWorkshop Exercises: Throughout the workshop we'll
  walk through exercises that you can complete at your own pace later via t

  glossaries of common terms\, prompt engineering guides and video content.
 \nCommunity: The portal also serves as a community hub where you can engag
 e with current and prior students of Practical:AI's workshops. \nThe Pract
 ical:AI difference\nWe're not about vague strategies or far-future specula
 tion - we focus on the transformative tools that are available today and t
 he practical skills you can apply immediately.\nExpert-Led Workshops: Our 
 courses are taught by seasoned professionals with over 20 years of experie
 nce in AI and Machine Learning\, providing unparalleled technical depth an
 d expertise.\nGrounded in Research: We stay close to the latest AI develop
 ments\, integrating insights from recent papers and research directly into
  our curriculum with citations provided at every step.\nNot hype: We're no

 nes\, it's our skills\, knowledge and mindset that makes us special.\nEmpo
 wer yourself. Innovate your business. Shape the future with PracticalAI. \
