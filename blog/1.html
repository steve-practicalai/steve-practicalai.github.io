<p>A lot of what Silicon Valley morphed into over this 20 year boom that followed the .com crash was really just cosplay of the 90s. The 90s was driven by a wild-eyed excitement that came from simply looking at the pace of progress, making conservative projections out and seeing that <em>everything was going to change</em>.</p>
<p>That same future forecasting is what's driving the current AI hype bubble but just like the .com bubble they'll likely miss the landing in the short term (i.e. stock market crash) but exceed everyone's expectations in the long run (e.g. just like social media did in the 2000s).</p>
<p>I think the clearest signal of what's driving the AI hype is the current near-exponential quality-to-cost ratio improvements we're seeing on LLM models. AI models are returning better results, at a lower cost, which is improving at a rate that's almost impossible to keep up with.</p>
<p>That kind of runaway progress is what the 90s was like in tech and it's something that every tech startup since then has tried and mostly failed to generate, increasingly with technologies like VR and Crypto they've failed to even successfully <em>mimic</em> it.</p>

<p>The cost per million tokens (where 100 tokens is roughly 75 words) to analyse those meeting transcripts has plummeted at the same time the overall quality has skyrocketed. How accurate the LLM is at detecting something like employee recognition has gone from largely useless with GPT3.5 to probably human equivalent from GPT4o onward.</p>
<p>In March 2023 OpenAI was charging $2 per million tokens of input for the lightweight GPT3.5 model, today you can get that for $0.24 but with the substantially better GPT4o-mini.</p>
<p>In Nov 2023 Anthropic was charging $8 per million tokens on their flagship Claude3, today you use the also substantially better Claude3.5 for just $3.</p>
<p>If that pace of change wasn't fast enough Meta has just announced that they've open sourced their Llama 3.1 model: <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/</a></p>

Here we're seeing the same thing happening with AI but at an even faster pace.</p>
<p>Great news for us consumers, not sure if it's also great news for the tech giants. I think we can confidently predict increased individual productivity and vast untapped seas of potential innovation for new NZ Startups, for everything else (including 'Big Tech' itself) all bets are off.</p>
<p>If nothing in AI improves from today then we're still set for 10 years of incredible changes as we unlock the biggest productivity boost since the spreadsheet. But that's not enough for big tech, they're betting everything on the next phase which is successfully achieving agentic AI. </p>
<p>Importantly I believe they're going to achieve that but with current investment levels they need to stick the landing this year, early 2025 at the latest and if they don't it will be the .com bubble all over again (followed by everything they promised getting delivered anyway after the hype has died down). </p>
