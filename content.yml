      At PracticalAI, we compare AI to the humble spreadsheets every business uses – it's an incredibly powerful tool, but 20 years ago without some basic skills and training it might have been mistaken for just a silly gimmick.
      
      The truth is, just like the humble spreadsheet, AI will be a game-changer for every business and professional across every industry – if you know how to use it.
