## Introduction

At PracticalAI, we compare AI to the humble spreadsheet every business uses – it's an incredibly powerful tool, but 20 years ago without some basic skills and training it might have been mistaken for just a silly gimmick.
  
The truth is, just like the humble spreadsheet, AI will be a game-changer for every business and professional across every industry – if you know how to use it.

## AI Benefits

- Boost Your Productivity
  Automate those mindnumbing tasks and offload drudge work to free up time for the important stuff.

- Raise the floor
  AI isn't a match in your area of expertise but it's a world class expert in everything you're not.

- Spark Innovation
  Supercharge your brainstorming with new ideas and solutions you might not have thought of before.

- Improve Customer Experience
  Offer personalised services that'll have your customers raving.

Don't let AI pass you by. Here in NZ, let's do to AI what we did to cafes. After all, we don't grow the coffee or make espresso machines, it's our skills, knowledge and mindset that makes us special.
