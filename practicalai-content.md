## Introduction

At PracticalAI, we compare AI to the humble spreadsheet – it's an incredibly powerful tool, but without some basic skills and training it might be mistaken for just a silly gimmick. The truth is, just like the humble spreadsheet, AI will be a game-changer for every business and professional across every industry – if you know how to use it.

## AI Benefits

- **Boost Your Productivity**
  Automate those mind-numbing tasks and offload drudge work to free up time for the important stuff.

- **Raise the floor**
  AI isn't a match in your area of expertise but it's a world class expert in everything you're not an expert in.

- **Spark Innovation**
  Supercharge your brainstorming for new ideas and solutions you might not have thought of before.

- **Improve Customer Experience**
  Offer personalised services that'll have your customers raving.

Don't let AI pass you by. Here in NZ, let's do to AI what we did to cafes. After all, we don't grow the coffee or make espresso machines, it's our skills, knowledge and mindset that makes us special.
