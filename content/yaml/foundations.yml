      # Kickstart your AI journey with Practical:AI's foundation course.

      Artificial Intelligence is about to radically change your business and personal productivity, even with just the capabilities that have already been unlocked today. The goal of Practical:AI is to make sure you're in the driver seat for that change rather than adapting to it.

      **For Professionals**: 
      AI training will help future-proof your career with highly in-demand AI skills, supercharge productivity and make you the go-to person for AI in the workplace. 

      **For Businesses**
      The first step in building your internal AI capability is to demystify AI and understand what it can and can't do without the tech industry hype. Starting from this solid Foundation we can support building out your AI capability with our Skills and Advanced courses for your team.

      # What's in the workshop?

      Our half-day Foundations workshop will equip you with:

      1. **AI Theory (That Won't Put You to Sleep)**: Understand how AI ticks under the hood without needing a math PhD.
      2. **Extracting real business value**: AI is an endless goldmine of value, learn how to 'mine' it safely.
      3. **Risks and challenges**: Learn about what is meant when we say AI "hallucinates", the bias risks and how they can be managed.
      4. **The new frontier**: AI has upended the status quo to the extent everything will need to be reevaluated, learn to seperate the low-hanging fruit from the AI [slop](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/style/ai-search-slop.html).

      Each course is also paired with access to a 3 month subscription to Practical:AI User Group portal:

      1. **Workshop Exercises**: Throughout the workshop we'll walk through exercises that you can complete at your own pace later via the portal.
      2. **AI Content**: Practical:AI maintains a library of resources from glossaries of common terms, prompt engineering guides and video content.
      3. **Community**: The portal also serves as a community hub where you can engage with current and prior students of Practical:AI's workshops.
